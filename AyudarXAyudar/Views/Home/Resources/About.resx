    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>To sustain this shelter we have to work hard every day, there is no rest and we do fund-raisers. Oh, if there many happy little faces, that makes up for our sacrifice. 
We also have the support of economic donations, food, cleaning supplies, building materials to rennovate the refuge from people who, like us, love animals and pitch in for our cause.
In this journey there have been ups and downs, some furballs have gone over the rainbow bridge, volunteer vets have helped them to leave so they do not continue suffering. 
There have been painful moments, but it's also very gratifying to see so many furballs enjoy a new home next to a family that loves and cares for them. 
This is our objective: rescue, cure, and find them a home.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Information" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So we had to rent a house without light, nor water, and that was how we managed to keep them secure. 
Over time people joined our cause but they were not constant and gave up. 
We continue and after some years we have been lent some land and with much effort we have rennovated and we still have much to do with scarce resources. 
It has become a paradise for them.</value>

  <data name="Intro" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Five years ago we started rescuing dogs on Baghdad Beach, animals that were abandoned to their fate. 
We would take them to our house and improvise shelters with canvas and cardboard so we could to protect them. 
The neighbors would lend us their covered yard to protect them because our house was not big enough.  
We had rescued so many that the place was insufficient.</value>

  <data name="Mission" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our mission: that there are no animals wandering the streets left to their fate, gambling with danger and help them to find a family. 
All the furballs who arrive at the shelter are taken care of by a veterinarian. 
They are given their vaccines. 
They are dewormed.
They are given treatment if required.
They are operated on if they need surgery.
They are rehabilitated.
They are sterilized and only then are ready for adoption. 
When necessary, they are tested for the heartworm, and given the Bordetella vaccine. 
All this costs a lot of money, so we are always in need of help.</value>
